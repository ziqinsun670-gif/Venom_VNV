## Covered Modules

- [System Bringup]({{ '/en/venom_bringup' | relative_url }})
- [Robot Description]({{ '/en/venom_robot_description' | relative_url }})

## Layer Role

Single packages answer “how one module runs.”  
The system layer answers “how the whole robot runs together.”

## Why This Is Not Planning

- the system layer composes modules and modes
- it does not own trajectory-generation algorithms
- planners such as `ego_planner` should live under `planning/`
